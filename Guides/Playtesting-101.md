# Playtesting 101

First of all: thank you! One of the most amazing things you can do for a game developer is to volunteer your time to testing and giving feedback on their project. Helping a dev find bugs, understand user frustrations, and make their game better is possibly the greatest gift you can give them.

Before jumping headlong into sending a bird-shot scattering of thoughts and feedback to the developer, here are a few things that may be helpful to keep in mind when plyatesting their game. This is by no means a "do or die" list or even the "definitive" list of suggestions. This is just a list of things that have smoothed out the playtesting process when I've handed my games to playtesters. 


* <b>Ask Questions</b>: Don’t assume or worse yet “not worry about it.” Ask the developer for clarification on anything and everything. It could be that your question is a result of something not being clearly explained to you: you’ve just found your first “bug”!


* <b>Give Specific Feedback</b>: “This is dumb” or “This is boring” is not helpful. A good piece of feedback looks like this:

<em>“When playing level 14 I found that the monster was too easy to beat. It almost seemed like his punches didn’t effect my character and I could just stand there and punch. As a player I feel that a monster should be harder to beat. Is the easiness here intentional?”</em>

In this piece of feedback you see <b>where</b> you encountered the issues,<b>what</b> you had an issue with, and<b>why</b> you thought this was an issue.

If you'd like to use a template for your bug report or feedback, try using something like this:

| <b>Game</b>: Bob's Grand Adventure <br/>
| <b>System</b>: Windows 10 ASUS Laptop <br/>
| <b>Version of Game</b>: Alpha/Beta/1.0.4/etc <br/>
| <b>Issue</b>: A brief or detailed description of the problem you discovered <br/>
| <b>Replication</b>: How to replicate the issue: Play level 9 on Hard and press Shift 16 times <br/>


* <b>Take Screenshots</b>: “The thing at the top of the screen” is vague, but if you send a screenshot that clearly shows the giant red rectangle in the middle of what should be a Van Gogh painting, no words are really needed beyond “what’s with the big red rectangle.”

        <em>On Windows: select the window you want to take a screenshot of, hold down ALT then press PRINT SCREEN.</em>

        <em>On Mac: press COMMAND + SHIFT + 4</em>


* <b>Don’t Share Anything Without Permission</b>: Doesn’t matter if it’s quotes, screenshots, files, documents, or even the game itself: if you didn’t get explicit permission to show your roommate the game you’re playtesting, you’re violating the trust the developer put in you when they sent you the game.


* <b>Don’t Be Afraid To Be Critical</b>: Some of the most helpful feedback I’ve received has burst my bubble. But when the trampoline kangaroo makes a sudden appearance in my meditative game about transparent circles and you dislike it, tell me: I probably should dislike it too.
