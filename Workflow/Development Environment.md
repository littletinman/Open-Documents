A developers developer environment is like a virtual paradise of simplicity and productivity: at least, IMO it should be. 
The following document outlines the contents and tools of my personal development environment.

## System Requirements
I'm always looking for ways to develop software with minimal hardware requirements. I've been able to do some programming on a Raspberry Pi 2 but I've also grown accustomed to working with much speedier machines so I can't use such a device as my main workstation.

### Minimum
*This is the setup of my backup machine that is ready to step in if ever my main machine fails.*
- **Processor**: Intel i3 dual core
- **Ram**: DDR2 4GB
- **HDD**: 120GB

### Recommended
*This is the setup for my main machine.*
- **Processor**: 4th Gen Intel i7 with hyperthreading
- **Ram**: DDR3 8GB
- **SSD**: 250GB

### Summary
The main things you want is at least dual core because I just run photoshop and intellij. I'm not into using a gaming machine for development because I find having all that extra power leads to more time gaming and less time programming.
