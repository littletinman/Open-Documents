# Standards: Repositories

This document outlines the standard structure of a clear and effective git repository. An effective repository outlines the contents, provides consistent structure, and has a clear history.

##### Default Folders

Every git repository should have 4 main folders. Below these folders should be Camel case Directories descriptive of thier contents.

- **Design** <br />
  *All design files and resources are contained in here that relate to the design process of a project. PSDs, stock images, sketches, and mockups.*
- **Project** <br />
  *This should contain the code: the root of your programming. Essentially, someone should be able to import this folder into an IDE and be able to run without going any deeper.*
- **Promotion** <br />
  *Posters, banners, social media related images and text should all be here. This should build off of "Design" but should be seperate to avoid confusion when developing.*
- **Documentation**  <br />
  *Style guides, coding standards, and especially journal entries should be contained in this folder. Anything that would help another contributer with jumping in.*
