# Playtesting 101

So you've been given a copy of a new game to try out and give feedback on: Congrats! Enjoy the excitement of being one of the first to play a developer’s new game! Before you start going crazy with excitement however, here are a few things that are important things for you to know when playtesting.


# The “DO”s

* <b>Ask Questions</b>: Don’t assume or worse yet “not worry about it.” Ask the developer for clarification on anything and everything. It could be that your question is a result of something not being clearly explained to you: you’ve just found your first “bug”!

* <b>Give Specific Feedback</b>: “This is dumb” or “This is boring” is not helpful. A good piece of feedback looks like this:

         <em>“When playing level 14 I found that the monster was too easy to beat. It almost seemed like his punches didn’t effect my character and I could just stand there and punch. As a player I feel that a monster should be harder to beat. Is the easiness here intentional?”</em>

In this piece of feedback you see <b>where</b> you encountered the issues,<b>what</b> you had an issue with, and<b>why</b> you thought this was an issue.


* <b>Take Screenshots</b>: “The thing at the top of the screen” is vague, but if you send a screenshot that clearly shows the giant red rectangle in the middle of what should be a Van Gogh painting, no words are really needed beyond “what’s with the big red rectangle.”

        <em>On Windows: select the window you want to take a screenshot of, hold down ALT then press PRINT SCREEN.</em>

        <em>On Mac: press COMMAND + SHIFT + 4</em>

# The “DON’T”s

* <b>Don’t Share Anything Without Permission</b>: Doesn’t matter if it’s quotes, screenshots, files, documents, or even the game itself: if you didn’t get explicit permission to show your roommate the game you’re playtesting, you’re violating the trust the developer put in you when they sent you the game.


* <b>Don’t Be Afraid To Be Critical</b>: Some of the most helpful feedback I’ve received has burst my bubble. But when the trampoline kangaroo makes a sudden appearance in my meditative game about transparent circles and you dislike it, tell me: I probably should dislike it too.

* <b>Say “It’s Not My Type Of Game”</b>: Chances are that’s why you were selected to get an early copy of the game. One of the worst mistakes a developer can make is to only get feedback from people who absolutely love that “style” of game. I want you to tell me “this type of game bores me because a, b, and c. If you just added such-and-such it might actually make me tolerate it.”

* <b>“Forget” To Send Feedback</b>: If you don’t have the time, desire, or just hate testing games, just tell the developer to “F OFF!”... Actually don’t do that, it would be mean. Instead just reply “Thanks, but I’m unable to participate . Good luck with the release!”
